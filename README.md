# ATMProjectbyDanielFomin

I have done my best to adhere to the requirments set forth by this project and I believe I have successfully done so.

This project cosists of a the main java application split into four classes as well as a maven pom.xml with the required dependencies.

The main body of the project consists of the ATMRunnable class with six methods including the main. 

A use case of this project would include the initialization of the atm
This will prompt the user for a pin
The pin will then be searched for however the user will be allowed to access the next stages of options wether they have put in a valid pin or not
The user is given 4 choices which are to see their balance, their total amount that they can withdraw, the ability to make a withdrawl, the ability to turminate that menu
the user may only select the 4th option if they have not entered a valid pin earlier
The user may choose to withdraw money eg 35 euro
This will prompt the program to make the calculations required to return the accurate amount of notes required for that amount

This will be dispenced into the commandline as a string as well as the total and the money left in the user's account
